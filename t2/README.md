## Usage:

    python3 dithering.py
    or
    python3 gen_results.py

## About the files:

    The "dithering.py" file works if you want to use your own parameters and images. It contains the dithering methods and all implementation of the problem.
    The "gen_results.py" was design to generate images with specific parameters for validation purpose.

## Testing:

    It's possible to test the dithering.py by using the gen_results.py and modifying the filepath of the input images.
